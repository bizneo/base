### Bizneo Dev Team Values

The Bizneo Dev Team aims to promote an inclusive and diverse space
within the projects of the company and wherever else our admins and users
have a voice as advocates that can make an impact.

Admin/senior/privileged users will act as mentors/sponsors of newcomers and will
make sure their experience is satisfactory and enriching throughout their
interactions with our company.

When reviewing contributions, we will actively fight unconscious bias with any
resources we have at hand to make the process as fair as we can.

Our company and all of its repos aim to be a safe space, and our [code of
conduct](https://github.com/bizneo/base/blob/master/files/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
reflects that violence, harrassment or hate speech will not be tolerated.
